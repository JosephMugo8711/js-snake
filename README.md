## Project Description
The snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food (represented by apples) to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the boundaries of the screen.

Future development
1. Enhancing the user experience by displaying a "Game Over" message and an option to restart the game after it ends. 
2. A message will be added to indicate to the user that the game is starting, enhancing the overall game flow and usability.
